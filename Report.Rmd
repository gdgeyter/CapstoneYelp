# Title 

This is the final report written for the Capstone project for the Coursera Data 
Science Specialization. In this project we use the data made public for the 
[Yelp Dataset Challenge][1]. The main focus of this report is based on 
identifying and clustering groups of people with similar interests in food and 
environment. Additionally we will also investigate if some overlap exists 
between different groups (for example a "vegan" and "hispters" group could 
partially overlap).

# Introduction

In this project we try to answer the question if there are clearly separated
groups of people and their preferences of both dietary restrictions and the 
environment. For example a related question would be "Do vegetarians have a 
preferences for hipster places?". The reason why this question could be 
interesting is for better customer profiling. For example, in the above case
vegetarian restaurants could target potential customers more accurately, 
increasing their publicity with minimal cost. Not only would they be able to 
address new clients, they could also better suit the needs and wishes of the 
existing customers. In this way they could build up the returning customer base
which is vital for any restaurant to produce steady cash flows and remain open
for business.

## Data merging and aggregating

To answer these questions we use a combination of three different data sets from
the [Yelp Dataset Challenge][1]:

1. yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
2. yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
3. yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

![Schematic overview of merging and linking of datasets](Yelp2.PNG)

Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of how we link the different data sets in 
order to get all of the necessary data combined before we move to the analysis.
As this project is specifically focused on food, we first narrow down to the 
reviews for business who are clearly based on preparing food (and not for 
example specific food shops). From the different categories of businesses
we have manually selected all relevant ones to narrow down the selection.
As this data set includes the environment (essentially the 'Ambience') and 
'Dietary Restrictions' it is important to take this information and link it to 
a specific user. 

The next step consists of merging the reviews with the food selected business. 
We need this merging for two reasons:

1. Not all the reviews were written on a business we are interested in
2. The reviews contain the link between businessID and userID

Once we have merged the business and reviews data set we get rid of all the 
information we don't need for our analysis, like the text of the review it self.
Doing so we create lighter data frame which should be easier to handle in the 
upcoming steps. The next thing we have to do is then 
aggregate this frame to have one line per unique user as this data frame still 
contains multiple lines per review. However, what we need in the end is a 
specific 'user-profile' so therefore we need to combine the
several reviews into one. The final step remaining is to merge the newly created
dataframe of relevant reviews with the dataset containing the users information.
This can be easily done by merging using the userid. Each of these steps is 
explained in more detail in the next chapter. Once the final frame is created we
check if certain ambience and dietary restrictions have tendancy to occur more 
or less frequently with others. However before we can do this it is important to
make the necessary corrections on numbers as not all of them have the same 
occurancy in the final data set. This will be discussed in the 'Results' 
chapter.
# Methods and Data 
In this section we dig a bit deeper into what manipulations we have to done
reach to the 'user-profiles'. To keep this report light and within 5 page limit
not all steps are included here. However, if not all steps are perfectly clear
are the reader is interested in finding out specific details, feel free to look
at the code posted on my [GitHub][2]. 

We first start by loading the necessary packages, reading in the data files and 
saving it so it can be loaded faster afterwards. 
```{r, Read in Datasets, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if(!require('BBmisc')){
    install.packages('BBmisc',dep=TRUE)
}
# load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library('BBmisc'))
pkgs <- c('jsonlite','plyr','plyr','stringr','doParallel','ff','ffbase',
          'corrplot','rjson','Hmisc')
suppressAll(lib(pkgs)); rm(pkgs)
registerDoParallel(cores=4)
# .. cut part of the code here. see GitHub
```
Next we make the first selection 'Select Food related' on the business file to 
select only the relevant food preparation business (i.e. any 'sort' of
restaurant). The file 'FoodStuff.csv' contains a list of manually selected 
relevant categories.

```{r, Selection 1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
load(paste0(getwd(),'/Capstone_Quiz.RData'))
user <- dat[['user']]
bus <- dat[['business']]
reviews <- dat[['review']]
FoodCat<- read.csv("FoodStuff.csv",sep = ";", dec = ".")
foodcat <- as.vector(FoodCat$Cat)
isFoodRelated <- sapply(1:nrow(bus), function(x) sum(foodcat %in% unlist(bus$categories[x])) >0)
bus.selec <- bus[isFoodRelated,]
```
The second step, 'Merge on business_ID', starts by making the 'ambience' and
dietary restriction columns from boolean to numeric. This will be important
in step 3. We first only select the columns we need from the reviews file.
Next, we filter on those reviews which were written on relevant businesses.
Finally we merge the reviews with the businesses file using the businessID.

```{r, Selection 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
rev.sm <- reviews[, which(names(reviews) %in% c("user_id", "stars", "business_id"))]
busids <- rev.sm$business_id
pos.bus<- match(busids,bus.narrowed$buID)
userids <- rev.sm$user_id
df.positions <- data.frame(pos.bus = pos.bus, busID= busids, userids=userids)
df.pos.comp <- na.omit(df.positions)
bus.narrowed$busID <- bus.narrowed$buID
df.bu <- merge(df.pos.comp, bus.narrowed, by="busID")
```

The third step consists of aggregating the multiple reviews per user into one.
This can be done by simply stacking the ambience and dietary restrictions after
converting them to a numeric value. So for example, if a user has written two
reviews on a business categorized as 'trendy', the rows in the data frame will
consists of one user only but the column 'trendy' will now contain '2' instead
of 'TRUE'. The 4 step is then just to merge this data frame with the user data
frame using the userid. 

```{r, Selection 3 and 4, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
df.bu2 <- df.bu[, -which(names(df.bu) %in% c("busID", "pos.bus","buID"))]
df.bu2 <- na.omit(df.bu2)
df.bu2$nrev <- rep(1,nrow(df.bu2))
df.bu3 <- ddply(df.bu2,"userids",numcolwise(sum))
names(df.bu3)[names(df.bu3) == 'userids'] <- 'user_id'
df.bu4 <- merge(user,df.bu3, by="user_id")
df.final <- df.bu4
```

# Results 
```{r, readcol, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
df.colsums  <- read.csv("colsums .csv",sep = ";", dec = ".")
df.envDiet  <- read.csv("envDiet .csv",sep = ";", dec = ".")
corr.envDiet <- cor(df.envDiet)
```

Now that we have created a final data frame containing all the information
let's have a look at the frequency of all the different ambiences and dietary 
restrictions.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=6, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap=" Frequency of Ambience and Dieterary restrictions among user profiles"}
barplt <- ggplot(data = df.colsums, 
                 aes(x = Environment, y=UserReviews)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="darkgreen",colour="darkgrey")+
    xlab("Ambience and Dietary restrictions") +
    ylab("User reviews") +
    theme_bw()+theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
barplt
```

From Figure 2 one could assume that there are lot of vegetarians among the 
users. However, it is important to notice that we have created these profiles 
based on business traits. For example, a non-vegetarian could easily have a 
hamburger in a place that also serves vegetarian dishes but obviously that does
not make him a vegetarian. Therefore, before we can draw any conclusions on 
which traits occur more (or less) frequently together we must weight this by
the absolute occurence. This is shown in the following step. First we must
correct the 'user-profile' by weighing the number of reviews he/she has written
on a certain type of restaurant by the total number of reviews the user has 
written. Next, this is also correct by the total amount of businesses having
this specific trait. 

```{r, Corrections, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
for(i in 1:length(envDiet)){
    df.final[[envDiet[i]]] <- df.final[[envDiet[i]]]/df.final$nrev
    df.final[[envDiet[i]]] <- df.final[[envDiet[i]]]/sum(df.final[[envDiet[i]]])
}
```
Now that we have the corrected/weighted occurences we can look at how frequently
they appear together. This can be done by calculating the correlation matrix
among all traits. This matrix will indicate a value between -1 to +1 indicating 
how likely or unlikely two traits will pair up. This matrix can be seen in 
Figure 3 and will be discussed in the next chapter.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Weighted correlation among different ambiences and dieterary restrictions"}
corrplot(corr.envDiet, method = "ellipse")
```

# Discussion 

Before we begin this dicussion it is important to notice 
*Correlation is not causation*. Therefore, one should **ALWAYS** we very 
careful when drawing conclusions from them. Because of this, and because of the
smaller scale of this project, all the conclusions here will be expressed very
conservativaly and should also be regarded as such. As a final remark, we will
speak of f.e. 'romantic users' while it is important to remember that these are
always trait of businesses were users go. However we use this to keep the 
discussion light and not overly verbose.

When looking at Figure 3 we notice a few things:

1. Not suprisingly there is a high tendency for dietary restrictions to pair up. this is most likely partly due to an overlap in dietary restrictions (f.e. all vegans are vegetarians and dairy.free) and because of business specifically focussing more on several dietary restrictions.
2. Romantic users tend to be more upscale. This might not be so suprising as most
people won't take their dates out on a cheap, fast-food restaurant.
3. Trendy people are more likely to be vegan and eat soy free.
4. Casual users are less likely to be classy, hispters or trendy. Interestingly they have slightly higher tendency towards eating gluten free while being less likely to be vegan or vegetarian

These are just a few first remarks that can be made. Because of the richness of 
this Yelp dataset, much more questions could be answered. We believe that this 
is just a potential start of investigating many tendencies among users and could
easily be extendend. For example, not just looking at dietary restrictions but
at specific cuisines like "Italian" and the business ambience. Having this 
information could be an important tool for some businesses to adjust more to 
their clients needs. For example, using conclusion 2 from this work, upscale 
restaurants could focus specifically on advertising romantic dinners for two.
This is just a small example of the amount of information that could be locked in this
data set alone so imagine what could be learned if it was enriched with other data
like geospatial information of social network interests.
