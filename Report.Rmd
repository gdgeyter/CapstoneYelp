# Title 

This is the final report written for the Capstone project for the Coursera Data 
Science Specialization. In this project we use the data made public for the 
[Yelp Dataset Challenge][1]. The main focus of this report is based on 
identifying and clustering groups of people with similar interests in food and 
environment. Additionally we will also investigate if some overlap exists 
between different groups (for example a "vegan" and "hispters" group could 
partially overlap).

# Introduction

In this project we try to answer the question if there are clearly separated
groups of people and their preferences of both dietary restrictions and the 
environment. For example a related question would be "Do vegetarians have a 
preferences for hipster places?". The reason why this question could be 
interesting is for better customer profiling. For example, in the above case
vegetarian restaurants could target potential customers more accurately, 
increasing their publicity with minimal cost. Not only would they be able to 
address new clients, they could also better suit the needs and wishes of the 
existing customers. In this way they could build up the returning customer base
which is vital for any restaurant to produce steady cash flows and remain open
for business.

To answer these questions we use a combination of three different data sets from
the [Yelp Dataset Challenge][1]:

1. yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
2. yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
3. yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

Figure 1 shows a schematic overview of how we link the different data sets in 
order to get all of the necessary data combined before we move to the analysis.
As this project is specifically focused on food, we first narrow down to the 
reviews for business who are clearly based on preparing food (and not for 
example specific food shops). From the different categories of businesses
we have manually selected all relevant ones to narrow down the selection.
As this data set includes the environment (essentially the 'Ambience') and 
'Dietary Restrictions' it is important to take this information and link it to 
a specific user. 

The next step consists of merging the reviews with the food selected business. 
We need this merging for two reasons:

1. Not all the reviews were written on a business we are interested in
2. The reviews contain the link between businessID and userID

Once we have merged the business and reviews data set we get rid of all the 
information we don't need for our analysis, like the text of the review it self.
Doing so we create lighter data frame which should be easier to handle in the 
upcoming steps. The next step consists of merging the newly created dataframe of 
relevant reviews with the dataset containing the users information. This can be 
easily done by merging using the userid. The last thing we have to do is then 
aggregate this frame to have one line per unique user as this data frame still 
contains multiple lines per review. However, what we need in the end is a 
specific 'user-profile' so therefore we need to combine the
several reviews into one. Each of these steps is explained in more detail in the 
next chapter.

# Methods and Data 

In this section we dig a bit deeper into what manipulations we have to done
reach to the 'user-profiles'. To keep this report light and within 5 page limit
not all steps are included here. However, if not all steps are perfectly clear
are the reader is interested in finding out specific details, feel free to look
at the code posted on my [GitHub][2]. 

We first start by loading the necessary packages, reading in the data files and 
saving it so it can be loaded faster afterwards. 
```{r, Read in Datasets, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if(!require('BBmisc')){
    install.packages('BBmisc',dep=TRUE)
}
# load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library('BBmisc'))
pkgs <- c('jsonlite','plyr','plyr','stringr','doParallel','ff','ffbase',
          'corrplot','rjson','Hmisc')
suppressAll(lib(pkgs)); rm(pkgs)
registerDoParallel(cores=4)
# .. cut part of the code here. see GitHub
```
Next we make the first selection 'Select Food related' on the business file to 
select only the relevant food preparation business (i.e. any 'sort' of
restaurant). The file 'FoodStuff.csv' contains a list of manually selected 
relevant categories.

```{r, Selection 1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
load(paste0(getwd(),'/Capstone_Quiz.RData'))
user <- dat[['user']]
bus <- dat[['business']]
reviews <- dat[['review']]
FoodCat<- read.csv("FoodStuff.csv",sep = ";", dec = ".")
foodcat <- as.vector(FoodCat$Cat)
isFoodRelated <- sapply(1:nrow(bus), function(x) sum(foodcat %in% unlist(bus$categories[x])) >0)
bus.selec <- bus[isFoodRelated,]
```
The second step, 'Merge on business_ID', starts by making the 'ambience' and
dietary restriction columns from boolean to numeric. This will be important
in step 4. We first only select the columns we need from the reviews file.
Next, we filter on those reviews which were written on relevant businesses.
Finally we merge the reviews with the businesses file using the businessID.

```{r, Selection 2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
rev.sm <- reviews[, which(names(reviews) %in% c("user_id", "stars", "business_id"))]
busids <- rev.sm$business_id
pos.bus<- match(busids,bus.narrowed$buID)
userids <- rev.sm$user_id
df.positions <- data.frame(pos.bus = pos.bus, busID= busids, userids=userids)
df.pos.comp <- na.omit(df.positions)
bus.narrowed$busID <- bus.narrowed$buID
df.bu <- merge(df.pos.comp, bus.narrowed, by="busID")
```
